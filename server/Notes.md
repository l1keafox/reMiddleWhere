# Demo Day Notes

## Round 1 - Hiten Vasnani

- Marketing → customer feedback - start to shape project towards customer experience
- Make project compatible for Android-IOS-PWA-React Native
- Google Reviews already exist - what do consumers say? Follow existing project
- Two buckets: something we need to keep consistent, something we need to update
- Double down on the niche part - minimum friction
- Automated pipelines
- Label as a beta
- Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good
- Invite others through text message
- Top feature - filtering locations (restaurant, bar, beach)

## Round 2 - Matt M (M1 Finance)

- Login - distill down login page, make 2-3 sentences (About Us Page)
- Chat features (on my way, in traffic, “here” buttons, quick chat features)
- Get in front of family and friends
- Map bigger
- Longitude/Latitude → convert to city/state/neighborhood (more readable)
- CORS issues, exploring cache server side
- Review gaps in curriculum (URL/DNS/what happens from there?)

## Round 3 - Victor Moreno - AWS

- Finding specific types of meeting places
- JWT - authorize user and make sure they belong to group
- How to scale larger and larger (two primary approaches: what’s app → “distributed vm’s”, or active sockets in databases, elixir)
- Niche down project to specific groups and use cases
- Get rid of GraphQL (look for alternatives, simplify app for efficiency)
